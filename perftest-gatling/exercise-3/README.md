Criterias
---------------
Can you provide us with the following information:

Analyze
---------------
Analyze the test results in the team and come to a conclusion what the facts are.

Report
---------------
Prepare for a short debriefing by using the PROOF heuristic:
- Past: What have you recorded and why?
- Results: Have a look at the generated Gatling reports. What can you get from them?
- Obstacles: Anything that got in your way while testing? 
- Outlook: Is there anything left that you think needs to be done before doing an next iteration?
- Feelings: How do you feel regarding your performance test-session? Are you satisfied or would you change something before doing an other iteration?

Iterate
---------------
We're not done yet, there is one more Test Missions to go.
